WARP.md
This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

Project overview

This repository is a single-page, static web app (index.html) that renders a Leaflet map and overlays a physics-based planetary impact simulation. There are no package manifests, build tools, or tests configured.
Commands

Run locally (static server)
Using Python (recommended if available):
python -m http.server 8000
Open http://localhost:8000 and load index.html.
Using Node (via npx, no install needed):
npx serve -n -l 8000 .
Then open http://localhost:8000.
Build: Not applicable (no build step configured).
Lint: Not applicable (no lint tooling configured).
Test: Not applicable (no test tooling configured).
High-level architecture

UI layout
A full-viewport Leaflet map (#map) using OpenStreetMap tiles.
An input panel (fixed, top-right) with fields for asteroid diameter (m), impact velocity (km/s), latitude, and longitude. A “Run Impact Simulation” button triggers calculations.
A results panel (fixed, lower area) shows: energy (megatons TNT), crater radius (m), seismic magnitude (Mw), and damage radii for severe/moderate/light overpressure thresholds.
Physics and simulation (inline <script> in index.html)
Constants: gravitational acceleration, asteroid bulk density, joules-to-megatons conversion, Earth radius, seismic coupling factor, and crater scaling parameters.
Core functions:
massFromDiameter(d_m, density): sphere mass from diameter and density.
kineticEnergyJoules(d_m, v_kmps, density): 0.5·m·v^2 with km/s to m/s conversion.
joulesToMegatons(joules): converts joules to MT TNT equivalent.
estimateCraterRadiusM(energy_j): simple scaling law R = C·E^{1/3.4}.
estimateSeismicMagnitude(energy_j): Mw ≈ (2/3)·log10(E_seis[J]) − 3.2 with E_seis = coupling·E.
overpressureFromEnergyAtDistance(E_mt, distance_km): approximate blast scaling; computes incident overpressure in kPa from scaled distance.
calculateDamageRadii(E_mt): bisection search to find distances (km) at which overpressure falls to 35, 10, and 1 kPa.
simulateImpact(diameter_m, velocity_kms, lat, lon): returns inputs, constants, and computed results (energy, crater, seismic Mw, damage radii).
Rendering and interaction:
Map initialized with OpenStreetMap tile layer and default view (Mumbai area) at zoom 6.
Clicking “Run Impact Simulation” parses inputs, runs simulateImpact, recenters the map, updates the results panel, and renders Leaflet overlays:
Marker at impact point.
One small circle for crater radius (meters).
Three larger circles for severe, moderate, and light damage radii (kilometers converted to meters).
Overlays are cleared and redrawn on each simulation.
External dependencies
Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling.
Leaflet CSS/JS via CDN for mapping and vector overlays.
OpenStreetMap tile layer for basemap (attribution included in the map’s configuration).
Notes

No README.md, WARP.md, or tool-specific rule files (Claude/Cursor/Copilot) are present. If you introduce build, lint, or test tooling later, update this file with the corresponding commands (build, lint, run tests, and run a single test).
